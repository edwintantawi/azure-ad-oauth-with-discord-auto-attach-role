# azure-ad-oauth-with-discord-auto-attach-role

> ‚ùóThis is a playground project, there are still many edge cases that are not handled properly and also bad code writing!

The project contains applications that implement authentication with Microsoft Azure Active Directory with specific tenants/organizations which aims to limit authenticated users to certain tenants/organizations.

Then there is authentication with discord after the user login via Azure AD, when the user connects to discord, the user's discord account will get a special role automaticly.

## Project Goals

This project solves the problem of automating discord role assignment to users in certain tenants/organizations with Microsoft Azure Active Directory
